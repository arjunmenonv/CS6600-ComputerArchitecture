# CS6600-ComputerArchitecture
Assignments involving modelling and analysis of components of a modern computer from the graduate level Computer Architecture Course at IIT Madras (Fall 2021). This work was done in collaboration with [Akilesh Kannan](https://github.com/aklsh)

- [CacheParamEst](https://github.com/arjunmenonv/CS6600-ComputerArchitecture/tree/main/CacheParamEst): Reverse Engineering the Block Size and Associativity of L1 Cache of a desktop PC by observing the variation in access latency. 

- [AdapPageManage](https://github.com/arjunmenonv/CS6600-ComputerArchitecture/tree/main/AdapPageManage): Implementation of Hybrid Row Buffer Management for DRAMs by extending the command scheduler offered by the [USIMM](http://utaharch.blogspot.com/2012/02/usimm.html) DRAM simulator

- [MMU](https://github.com/arjunmenonv/CS6600-ComputerArchitecture/tree/main/MMU): Memory Management Unit Simulator in Python implementing multi-level virtual address translation enabling efficient page table management along with LRU replacement for evicting pages and page tables from memory. 

- [Tournament Branch Predictor](https://github.com/arjunmenonv/CS6600-ComputerArchitecture/tree/main/TournamentBPU): Implementation of the Tournament Branch Predictor, first introduced in the Alpha21264 processor. Uses framework provided by JILP for [CBP2016](https://github.com/arjunmenonv/CS6600-ComputerArchitecture/tree/main/TournamentBPU) championship.
